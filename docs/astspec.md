# Mulang AST spec

In this section, we will get into the technical details of the Mulang AST. It is built around 5 core elements:

* [Expressions](#expressions)
* [Patterns](#patterns)
* [Types](#types)
* Equations
* Generators

All the AST elements fall within any of these 5 categories.

## Expressions

Expressions are the most important element kind, since contain most of the information of a Mulang program and are always the root element of it. In fact, this implementation does not contain an `AST` or `Program` datatype - it is instead types as `Expression`.

Expression in Mulang model what you will normally spec in a language as a expression, that is something that holds a value and a type. For example, `4 + 5` and `[2, 3].toString()` are typical expresion.

However, Mulang extends this concept to most kind of elements in a program, regadless they are have an actual value in the original language. For example, class declarations and while statements are modeled as expression, although in many languages they aren't.

As a rule of thumb if something is or can be represented as an statement, declararion or expression, the it is modeled as `Expression` in Mulang AST.

### `Record`

> A `Record` represents a record, data or struct declaration,
> as found in most procedural and functional languages, like the C-like `struct` declaration

#### Syntax

```haskell
(Record Identifier)
```

#### C Example

```c
struct point {
  int x;
  int y;
}
```

```haskell
(Record "point")
```

#### Caveats

Currently, the `Record` expression does not hold information about the record contents.


### `TypeAlias`, `TypeSignature` and `TypeCast`

Mulang AST support for type analysis is quite limited, and it is mostly focused on expressions and declarations analysis. However, for sake of completeness and in order to provide some limited type-information in Mulang AST, `TypeAlias`, `TypeSignature` and `TypeCast` expressions are provided.

See [types section](#types) for more details.

### `EntryPoint`

> Entry point with its name and body. It typically correspond to C-like `main` procedures, or `program` declarations.

#### Syntax

```haskell
(EntryPoint Identifier Expression)
```

#### Java Example

```java

```

Assertions used within tests to dynamically ascertain the code's validity.

An assertion can be one of:

```

## Patterns

Patterns are the second most important element of Mulang AST. They represent things that don't hold a value, but are instead used to match values, like
patterns in imperative `case` or `switch` statements, functional pattern matching in `match` or `case` expressions, or exception matching in `try-catch` or `begin-rescue`-like statements in object oriented languages.

### `VariablePattern`

> Variable pattern represent a variable match. It corresponds to normal formal parameters in precedural languages,
> and to simple pattern matching against a free identifier.

#### Syntax

```haskell
(VariablePattern String)
```

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function foo(x, y) { }
```

  [(Equation
      [(VariablePattern "x"), (VariablePattern "y")]
      (UnguardedBody MuNil))])

## Types

When processing statically-typed languages, all type-information - regardless we are typing a function, a variable or a class - is represented with the `Type` ADT, can be one of:

  * `SimpleType`: composed by a type identifier and zero or type more constraints
  * `ParameterizedType`: composed by input type parmaters, an output type, and type constratins
  * `ConstrainedType`: composed by just type constraints.
  * `OtherType`: an unrecognized type

`Type`s can be introduced in the Mulang AST using the following elements:

### `TypeAlias`

> A `TypeAlias` represents a synonym for a type, like the `type` declaration in Haskell and Scala or C's `typedef`.
> It is a typical statically typed functional programming feature.

#### Syntax

```haskell
(TypeAlias Identifier Identifier)
```

#### Haskell Example

```haskell
type Point = (Int, Int)
```

```haskell
(TypeAlias "Point" "(Int, Int)")
```

### TypeSignature

> A `TypeSignature` represents an explicit type annotation for a computation,
> variable or module, as you can find in Java or Haskell.

#### Syntax

```haskell
(TypeSignature Identifier Type)
```

#### Haskell Examples

Simple types:

```haskell
name :: String
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "name" (SimpleType "String" []))
```

Simple types and constraints:

```haskell
f :: Num a => a
````

```haskell
(TypeSignature "f" (SimpleType "a" ["Num a"]))
```

Parameterized types:


```haskell
elem :: (Eq a, Foldable t) => a -> t a -> Bool
````

```haskell
(TypeSignature "elem" (ParameterizedType ["a", "t a"] "Bool" ["Eq a", "Foldable t"]))
```

#### Java Examples

In Java, as in most typed C-like languages, type signature and variable declarations are bound. This means that, for example, a local variable declaration will produce both a `TypeSignature` and a `Variable` expression.

Variable and attribute types:

```java
String name;
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "name" (SimpleType "String" []))
```

Method types:

```java
String f() { return null; }
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "f" (ParameterizedType [] "String" []))
```

Method types with type parameters:

```java
<A> A f() { return null; }
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "f" (ParameterizedType [] "A" ["A"]))
```

Method types with type parameters and constraints:

```java
<A super B> void f(A a) {}
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "f" (ParameterizedType ["A"] "void" ["A super B"]))
```

Class or interfaces types:

```java
class A<B extends C, D extends C> { }
```

```haskell
(TypeSignature "A" (ConstrainedType ["B extends C", "D extends C"]))
```


### `TypeCast`

> A `TypeCast` represent explictly giving a type to an expression
> which may have static or dynamic impact on the program. It is aimed to represent
> type-casts in c-like languages and inline type signatures in functional languages.

#### Syntax

```haskell
(TypeCast Expression Type)
```

#### Haskell Examples

Simple types:

```haskell
... = 4 :: Num a => a
```

```haskell
(TypeCast (MuNumber 4) (SimpleType "a" ["Num a"]))
```

#### Java Examples

Variable and attribute types:

```java
(Integer) 4;
```

```haskell
(TypeCast (MuNumber 4) (SimpleType "Integer" []))
```

```java
(Option<Integer>) something;
```

```haskell
(TypeCast (Reference "something") (SimpleType "Option<Integer>" []))
```

##### Caveats

The type constraints refer to type-constrained parametrizations that the cast introduces, and
not any other kind of constraints the cast uses. That is whay the following Java code:

```java
(Num<A>) something;
```

produces:

```haskell
(TypeCast (Reference "something") (SimpleType "Num<A>" []))
```

instead of:

```haskell
(TypeCast (Reference "something") (SimpleType "Num" ["A"]))
```
